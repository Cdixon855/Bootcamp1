# Bootcamp1
This is a series of the various lessons I am using to learn front end developing. I will be editing this
periodically to build on that which I have learned up to this point when time allows. Due to the nature of
the work I do, as well as the duration of the majority of my classes, this document may not be an accurate representation of what I have learned up to current, but I will try my best to keep this up to date.
